### Introduction

*Car Compare* will help you in your search to find the best cars for you.
Live at https://carcompare.pages.dev/

### Data

Data is maintained in a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pSgZbgI0v3NsVg8HstgLKMarZHsqFnvV9FTFB0mp47Q/edit?usp=sharing)

The data is then converted into a json (https://sheet.best/) and stored in a GitHub [page](https://github.com/anoopramanujam/anoopramanujam.github.io/tree/main/carcompare). The raw data is then used as the input for all car data in the application.

This work is still in progress. Let me know your feedback at https://twitter.com/anoopramanujam
